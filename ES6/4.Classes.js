/* 
Which Java developer doesn’t miss classes when switching to a JS project? 
Who doesn’t like explicit inheritance, like in Java language, instead of writing 
magic code for prototypal inheritance? Although some JS developers complained, 
classes have been introduced in ES6. They don’t change the concept of inheritance. 
They are just syntactic sugar for prototypal inheritance.
